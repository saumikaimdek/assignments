Que)Monk loves to play games. On his birthday, his friend gifted him a string S. Monk and his friend started playing a new game called as Suffix Game. In Suffix Game, Monk's friend will ask him lexicographically  smallest suffix of the string S. Monk wants to eat the cake first so he asked you to play the game.


Ans)

import java.util.*;

class Suffix {

    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {

        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scan.next();  
        int k=scan.nextInt(); 

        String[] suffix=new String[s.length()];

        for(int i=0;i<suffix.length;i++){ 

            suffix[i]=s.substring(i);   

        }

        Arrays.sort(suffix); 
        System.out.println(suffix[k-1]);

    }
}
