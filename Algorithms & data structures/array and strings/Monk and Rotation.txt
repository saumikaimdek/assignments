Q) Monk and Rotation
Monk loves to preform different operations on arrays, and so being the principal of Hackerearth School, he assigned a task to his new student Mishki. Mishki will be provided with an integer array A of size N and an integer K , where she needs to rotate the array in the right direction by K steps and then print the resultant array. As she is new to the school, please help her to complete the task.

import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = s.nextInt();
        s.nextLine(); //Skips the newline left behind by s.nextInt().

        for(int i=0; i<T; i++) {
            int N = s.nextInt(); int K = s.nextInt();
            int [] A = new int[N];
            s.nextLine(); 

            String posAr = s.nextLine();
            posAr = posAr.replaceAll("\\s+", " ");

            K = K % N;
            int index = 0;
            int occur = 0;
            while(K != 0 && occur < N - K && index < posAr.length()) {
                if(posAr.charAt(index++) == ' ') {
                    occur++;
                }
            }

            System.out.println(posAr.substring(index) + " " + posAr.substring(0, index));
        }
    }
}
